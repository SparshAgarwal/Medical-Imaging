function [himg, theta, r] = hough_trans(img)
% created by Jeanette Mumford 2/27/2017

% First, figure the max value for r (in positive direction).  This would be to the corner of the
% image (from the origin.  Solve using Pythagorean theorem
num_pos_r = 470;

% we will store our values in himg...since r can be negative, we'll create
% an r-vector to keep track of what locations in himg correspond to the
% values of r and a theta vector that does the same

i_rng = size(img, 1);
j_rng = size(img, 2);

r = -1*num_pos_r:num_pos_r;
theta = 1:360;
himg=zeros(length(r), length(theta));
for i=1:i_rng
  for j=1:j_rng
    if img(i,j) > 0
      for ang=theta
        theta_loop=ang*pi/180; % change to radians
        r_loop=round((i*cos(theta_loop))+(j*sin(theta_loop)));
        theta_ind = find(theta == ang);
        himg(find(r_loop == r), theta_ind)=himg(find(r_loop == r), theta_ind)+1;
